This is the results in the development of a project that was never finished. 
Some noteworthy progress however was made and thus I am pushing it to my Github account.
The name nidgate refers to the artist who proposed the project.

The idea was simple:
There's a chair in the room.
Someone sits down to activate the process.
Short sound clips start playing, one after another.
Eventually these sounds overlap and start to ressemble a crowd.
With time it becomes an overwhelming crowd of interrogations, eventually ending in noise.

The codes uses the Pydub library primarily. Yes we are using Python here.
One thing I didn't get far enough with was a true random behavior.
